Use a modern color palette with a primary and secondary color that complement each other. Consider using a sans-serif font like 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans' for better readability. Implement a consistent line height and letter spacing to improve text legibility. Ensure that there is sufficient whitespace around components to prevent clutter.
